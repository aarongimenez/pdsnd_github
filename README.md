### US Bike Share Data Project:
The Bikeshare Data Analysis Program allows users to explore and analyze bikeshare data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can specify a city, month, and day to analyze, and the program provides various statistics related to bikeshare usage in the selected city.
## Instructions
To run the program, you will need Python installed on your computer. The program uses the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, so make sure to have it installed as well.
Make sure you have the necessary CSV files for each city (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv) in the same directory as the Python script.
## Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the name of the city you want to analyze (Chicago, New York City, or Washington).

Next, you can choose to filter the data by specifying a month (e.g., January, February) or a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).

After applying any filters, the program will display statistics on the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip durations, and user demographics.

You can also choose to view raw data upon request to get more detailed information.

The program allows you to restart and analyze data for different cities or time periods.

## Data Sources
The bikeshare data used in this program is sourced from three CSV files, each containing data for one of the three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The files contain information about bike trips, including start and end times, stations, trip durations, and user details (user type, gender, and birth year).

## Requirements
Python (version 3.x)
Pandas library
